# Satellite Image Processing with Transfer Learning

## Overview

This repository focuses on satellite image processing using transfer learning with U-Net and ResNet34 models. The project aims to demonstrate the importance of advanced techniques in handling satellite imagery for various applications, including environmental monitoring and urban planning.

## Key Components

### 1. Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is employed to leverage pre-trained U-Net and ResNet34 models. This approach enhances the efficiency of the models, particularly in tasks related to semantic segmentation in satellite imagery.

### 2. U-Net and ResNet34

The U-Net architecture is utilized for its effectiveness in image segmentation, while ResNet34 is chosen for its robust feature extraction capabilities. Both models contribute to accurate and efficient processing of satellite images.

## Importance of Satellite Image Processing

Satellite image processing plays a crucial role in extracting valuable information from imagery captured by satellites. It aids in monitoring environmental changes, assessing land use, and enhancing disaster management capabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-image-processing.git
   cd satellite-image-processing
# Set the path to the ResNet34 weight file

Replace `"path/to/resnet34.h5"` with the actual path to your ResNet34 weight file.
# Run
python app.py
